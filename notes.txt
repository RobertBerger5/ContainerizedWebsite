Starting Everything Up:
    docker-compose up -d

Restarting:
    docker-compose down
    (may also need to do docker image rm (whatever the mysql one is) because it tends to be problematic)

Rebuilding Containers:
    cd (directory)
    docker build .

Using MySQL:
    docker exec -it dockerwebsite_mysql_1 mysql -uroot -p
    (alternatively, just install mysql and have /var/lib/mysql point to ./database (untested))

    Security - make a symbolic link to the keys: public & private, /etc/letsencrypt/{options-ssl-nginx,ssl-dhparams}
